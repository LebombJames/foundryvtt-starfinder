If the armor has an available upgrade slot, a barachius helm takes up one upgrade slot; otherwise, the helm counts as one of your two worn magic items.</p>\n<p>While wearing a barachius helm, once per day as a standard action, you can activate its ability to <em><strong>detect evil</strong></em> in your environment. Any creature you can see within 60 feet that has the evil subtype (such as a devil or an evil dragon) appears to have an obvious glowing outline visible only to you. Evil magic weapons (such as a rifle with the unholy weapon fusion) and other forms of evil technology gain a similar glowing outline. This doesn&rsquo;t not increase your visual range or allow you to see invisible creatures.</p>\n<p>In addition, once per day, the wearer of a barachius helm can use the barachius&rsquo;s firewall supernatural ability (see page 12).</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.hnnmUzbxZ8Zxawaf]{Wall of Fire}</p>"
