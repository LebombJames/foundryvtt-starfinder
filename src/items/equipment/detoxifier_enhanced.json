      "value": "<p>This synthetic organ replaces your liver, constantly filtering your bloodstream for toxic substances at a rate far more effective than that of an organic liver. The new organ is controlled by a wirelessly paired processor installed in your heart. When you have a standard detoxifier installed, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Fortitude saves against @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.GnEF27Oot3zqTaBQ]{Diseases}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Drugs}, @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poisons}, and radiation, and you are immune to addiction. Once per day when affected by a poison, you can roll your Fortitude save twice and take the better result. The enhanced detoxifier grants all of the above bonuses, as well as the ability to roll saving throws against poison twice per day. In addition, you automatically stabilize if reduced to 0 Hit Points as a result of damage from a poison. The elite detoxifier grants immunity to poison, as well as the bonuses to other Fortitude saves from the standard model.</p>"
