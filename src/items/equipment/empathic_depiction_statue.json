To collect such memories, a telepathic artist interviews the subject along with those who know or have strong memories of the subject. This process takes at least a week. In the past, these objects were magical, and some still are, but most modern&nbsp;empathic depictions&nbsp;are hybrid items that use advanced holography to create realistic memorials. Creating such an&nbsp;empathic depiction&nbsp;is a crafting task that uses the Engineering skill or an appropriate artistic Profession skill in a similar way. (A wholly magical version uses Mysticism instead.)<br /><br />Creatures within range of an&nbsp;empathic depiction&nbsp;(based on its model) can feel the emotions and recall the memories placed within it. A creature can attempt a Will saving throw (DC based on the model) to resist these experiences, which cause no damage or harmful effect. These hybrid items utilize magic and psychic energy, remaining active while an observer is in range. They can also be plugged into a power grid and operate continuously while such power flows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>An empathic statue depicts an individual&rsquo;s body in actual size, up to 12 feet tall. Larger individuals are depicted in miniature to the point necessary. An empathic statue has a range of 30 feet and a DC of 16.</strong></p>"
