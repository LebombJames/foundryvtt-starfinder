This item is usually something worn on or near the head, such as a necklace, headband, or a mask. While wearing this item, if you fail a Bluff, Culture, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check, as a reaction you can reroll the check and take the better result. You can also reroll a Profession check, provided the GM agrees the check involved some sort of interaction, such as acting, musical performance, public speaking, and the like. Once you benefit from a given <em>improvisation adornment</em>, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.</p>\n<p>The adornment allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mk 1 (Level 4):</strong> One reroll</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 2 (Level 8):</strong> Two rerolls</li>\n<li><strong>Mk 3 (Level 12): </strong>Three rerolls</li>\n</ul>"
