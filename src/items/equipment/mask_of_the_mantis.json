      "value": "<p>Once the traditional headgear for an ancient cabal of Golarion assassins called the Red Mantis, the mask of the mantis is now a relic sought by scholars of the missing planet, especially those seeking evidence that the Swarm visited Golarion at some time in the distant past. A mask of the mantis is a helmet that fully covers the head and face and has the appearance of a red insectile head with large compound eyes and long, backward-curving antennae. A mask of the mantis replaces a suit of armor&rsquo;s normal helmet (if any) and is incorporated into the armor&rsquo;s normal environmental protections; these protections do not function if the helm is removed. If the armor has an available upgrade slot, a mask of the mantis takes up one upgrade slot; otherwise, the mask counts as one of your two worn magic items.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While wearing a mask of the mantis, you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. In addition, a mask of the mantis has 2 daily charges. As a standard action, you can expend 1 charge to gain either the effects of see invisibility (as per the spell) for 30 minutes or a +3 insight bonus to Perception checks for 30 minutes. Both of these effects can be active simultaneously, and each charge is replenished 24 hours after being used.</p>"
