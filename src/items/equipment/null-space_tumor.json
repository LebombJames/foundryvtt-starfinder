      "value": "<p>While it is rare, some adventurers claim that exposing a&nbsp;null-space chamber&nbsp;to powerful teleportation magic (such as&nbsp;plane shift) can result in an unusual metallic growth appearing within the chamber. Scholars have yet to determine the true nature of these anomalies, which they call&nbsp;null-space tumors. A&nbsp;null-space tumor&nbsp;seems to have no obvious use or purpose, and merchants might sell you a&nbsp;null-space chamber&nbsp;with one inside without realizing it. The listed price and level is for a mk 1&nbsp;null-space chamber&nbsp;with a null-space tumor inside; rumors persist that larger and more disruptive&nbsp;null-space tumors&nbsp;exist. A&nbsp;null-space tumor&nbsp;has 1 bulk and can&rsquo;t be permanently removed from its associated chamber. You can&rsquo;t purposefully call up a&nbsp;null-space tumor&nbsp;from its chamber, but each time you call up another item from the chamber, there is a 20% chance that the&nbsp;null-space tumor&nbsp;appears instead. When that happens, the tumor&rsquo;s unusual properties randomly cause one of the following effects (roll 1d8 to determine the effect), after which the&nbsp;null-space tumor&nbsp;immediately teleports itself back into the chamber. The only way to destroy a&nbsp;null-space tumor&nbsp;is to destroy the&nbsp;null-space chamber&nbsp;it&rsquo;s attached to.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 98.9362%; height: 146px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 12.0558%; height: 18px; text-align: center;\"><strong>D8</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 87.0481%; height: 18px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 12.0558%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>1</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 87.0481%; height: 16px;\">You and all your gear become invisible for 1d4+1 rounds, but you move as if through a thick soup; your speed is reduced to 10 feet during this time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 12.0558%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\"><strong>2</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 87.0481%; height: 16px;\">Duplicates appear around you, as if you were affected by the spell mirror image for 1d4 minutes.
