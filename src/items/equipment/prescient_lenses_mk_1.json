A pair of lenses has one charge, which is refreshed each day, and a creature can benefit from a single use of&nbsp;prescient lenses&nbsp;each day (with any subsequent attempt showing the same few seconds of time as the first daily use).&nbsp;Prescient lenses&nbsp;were originally as optical enhancements for the robotic anacites of @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.Gxsy07AQwteFkPhh]{Aballon} and can be integrated into a robot for the listed price. Alternatively, they can be installed as a cybernetic eye augmentation for 1,000 additional credits.<br /><br /><strong>Mk 1: You can study the image in the lenses as a move action and gain a +1 insight bonus to a single attack roll, ability check, or skill check attempted before the start of your next turn. Attempting an attack roll or check expends the charge.</strong><br /><br />Mk 2: These function as&nbsp;mk 1 prescient lenses, but you can instead roll the attack roll or check twice and take the better of the two results.<br /><br />Mk 3: These function as&nbsp;mk 2 prescient lenses, but as a reaction you can instead reroll a failed attack roll, ability check, or skill check.</p>"
