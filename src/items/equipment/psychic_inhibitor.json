      "value": "<p>Crafted from shards of crystal mined in the Colonies and held together with an organic, waxy substance, a <em>psychic inhibitor</em> has the ability to disrupt telepathic communications. You can hold a <em>psychic inhibitor</em> in one hand and activate it once per day as a standard action by picturing a complex series of geometric shapes in your mind. When you do so, each creature with the limited telepathy or telepathy ability within 100 feet (including yourself) must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier) or have their mind flooded with unbearable psychic noise. Each affected creature loses its limited telepathy or telepathy ability and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to attack rolls, a &ndash;4 penalty to Will saving throws, and a &ndash;8 penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills for 1 hour. This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that succeeds at its save can&rsquo;t be affected by the same <em>psychic inhibitor</em> for 1 week.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A psychic inhibitor comes with four attuned <em>psychic disinhibitors</em> (these are created at the same time as the psychic inhibitor and are included in the price). A <em>psychic disinhibitor</em> is a flexible disk 1 inch in diameter that can be affixed to a creature&rsquo;s skin (preferably near the brain) to make the creature immune to the attuned <em>psychic inhibitor&rsquo;s</em> effects. A <em>psychic disinhibitor</em> counts as a worn magic item.</p>"
