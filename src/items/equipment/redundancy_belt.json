      "value": "<p>These devices were originally created by ilthisarian travelers early in their exploration of worlds beyond their native Arshalin. Most are wide mesh belts with entwined serpentine patterns, though&nbsp;redundancy belts&nbsp;made beyond Arshalin have a wider variety of appearances. After being worn for at least 24 hours, the belt creates duplicates of your existing vital organs that last as long as you wear the belt, magically and temporarily rearranging your internal anatomy to create space for them. You gain a +4 resistance bonus to Fortitude saving throws against @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.aKqRtg165rAly1Cc]{Poison}, to withstand the harmful effects of thick and thin atmospheres, and to avoid choking when breathing in heavy smoke. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score, and you always take minimum damage from falls (as though rolling a 1 for each die of damage).</p>"
