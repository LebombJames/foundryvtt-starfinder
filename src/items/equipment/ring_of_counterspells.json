A wily duelist might wear a ring of counterspells to foil one of an opponent&rsquo;s tricks, though these rings also work well against enemies who employ predictable offensive magic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spellcaster can target a <em>ring of counterspells</em> with a spell. That spell has no effect other than being stored in the ring. While you wear the ring, if you would be a target of the spell stored in the ring, the spell fails and has no effect. This countering is automatic; it requires no action or awareness on your part. Once the ring counters a spell, the stored spell dissipates, and the ring can&rsquo;t counter a spell until another is stored within it.</p>"
