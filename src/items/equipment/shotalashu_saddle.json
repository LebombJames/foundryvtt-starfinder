      "value": "<p>This traditional saddle for shotalashu riders is adorned with small, colorful gems and engraved with intricate images of lashunta culture. More than a simple decoration, however, a&nbsp;shotalashu saddle&nbsp;amplifies and solidifies the lashunta&rsquo;s telepathic bond with its mount through a series of telepathic relays that serve as conductors from the rider&rsquo;s body to the shotalashu&rsquo;s. While riding a&nbsp;shotalashu saddle, you gain a +5 bonus on Survival checks to ride the shotalashu. While austere, mass-produced&nbsp;shotalashu saddles&nbsp;that provide the same benefit as handmade versions certainly exist, most lashuntas consider it disrespectful to their mount not to use a lovingly crafted artisanal saddle. Particularly beautiful saddles often serve as cherished heirlooms, passed down through generations, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for lashuntas to mark special milestones in their loved ones&rsquo; lives with the gift of a new&nbsp;shotalashu saddle. A functional shotalashu saddle costs 300 credits, though particularly elaborate or ancient specimens may be worth many times more.</p>"
