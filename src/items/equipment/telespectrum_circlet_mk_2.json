The circlet increases the range of your limited telepathy based on the item&rsquo;s model number. In addition, the circlet has a number of charges per day based on its model number. As a move action, you can expend one of these charges to use your limited telepathy on any creature that knows a language rather than only those that share a language with you. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. Once the circlet&rsquo;s charges are expended, you can spend 1 Resolve Point in place of a charge to power the effect. The psychic link created by using a given circlet prevents you from using a different one for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Your limited telepathy range increases by 60 feet. The circlet has 9 charges.</strong></h3>"
