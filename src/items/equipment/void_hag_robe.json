In either case, you can treat the robe as a worn magic item. If you do so, you can use the void hag&rsquo;s stardust robes special ability. Once you use a given void hag robe, you can&rsquo;t use another&nbsp;void hag robe&nbsp;for 24 hours. However, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to use the robe&rsquo;s powers again during the same day, up to a maximum of three times per day.<br />The robes aboard the Crucible are cursed. If you use the robes as a worn magic item, you are affected as if you are inside a&nbsp;planar barrier. You can still travel to another plane in a larger vehicle, such as a starship entering @Compendium[sfrpg.setting.nb5A5e7HqTnvVjtX]{The Drift}, but you can&rsquo;t travel the planes bodily. The hags on the Crucible placed this curse knowing it would preclude the bearers of their robes from using spells such as plane shift to easily escape the PCs, whose attack the hags foresaw in visions.</p>"
