  "content": "<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 396</p>\n<p>On worlds where the atmosphere expands high above the physical boundaries of the surface, there exists a region of open air. Similarly, gas giants are made up of nothing more than a vast atmosphere, held in place by a starlike core. The most common rules sections to reference when using aerial terrain are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.I40i5CSMgG9zan2Y]{Falling} (see page 400), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.UK3JUtHrP0Wr4hfO]{Gravity} (see page 401), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.7ass7qJ9au7UeeJG]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404), and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63]{Weather} (see page 398). The rules for flying with the @Compendium[sfrpg.skills.6by4xbwlnTJWmiOG]{Acrobatics} skill are also critical for many creatures operating in an aerial environment.</p>\n<h3>Clouds</h3>\n<p>Most clouds are little more than condensed gas that obfuscates vision. Treat a cloud in an aerial environment using the same rules as fog cloud, except it’s a nonmagical effect. Other types of cloud exist, such as corrosive or toxic clouds, which operate in the same manner as those types of atmospheres (see above).</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In Aerial Terrain</h3>\n<p>How far a character can see in the air depends on the presence or absence of clouds. Creatures can usually see 5d8×100 feet if the sky is completely clear, with minimal clouds (or other aerial objects) blocking their views. Clouds generally provide enough concealment to hide within (though the hiding creature might have difficulty seeing out from its hiding place).</p>",
