The three categories of desert terrain are tundra (cold desert), rocky deserts (often temperate), and sandy deserts (often warm). The most common rules sections to reference for adventures in these areas are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.q9EhH1XBLFoM4aNG]{Cold Dangers} (see page 400), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.y2bNBKDGgf2EwmFP]{Heat Dangers} (see page 402), Starvation and Thirst (see page 404), and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63]{Weather} (see page 398).</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In The Desert</h3>\n<p>In general, the maximum distance in desert terrain at which a creature can succeed at a Perception check to detect the presence of others is 6d6×20 feet; beyond this distance, elevation changes and heat distortion in warm deserts makes sight-based Perception checks impossible. The presence of dunes in sandy deserts limits spotting distance to 6d6×10 feet. The scarcity of undergrowth or other elements that offer concealment or cover makes using Stealth more difficult.</p>",
