  "content": "<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 396</p>\n<p>Two categories of marsh exist: relatively dry moors and watery swamps. Both are often bordered by lakes (see page 396), which are effectively a third category of terrain found in marshes. The most common rules sections to reference for marshes and swamps are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.7ass7qJ9au7UeeJG]{Suffocation and Drowning} (see page 404), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.gZ8wUsXvIqlFxTpp]{Underwater Combat} (see page 405), and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.wIQut7wsYwTHsJ63]{Weather} (see below).</p>\n<h3>Bogs</h3>\n<p>If a square is part of a shallow bog, it has deep mud or standing water of about 1 foot in depth. It counts as difficult terrain, and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted in such a square increase by 2.<br /><br />A square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of standing water. It counts as difficult terrain, and Medium or larger creatures must spend 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller creatures must swim to move through a deep bog. Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.<br /><br />The water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller creatures gain improved cover. Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved cover. A creature with this improved cover takes a –10 penalty to attacks against creatures that aren’t underwater.<br /><br />Deep bog squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by an irregular ring of shallow bog squares.</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In A Marsh</h3>\n<p>In a moor, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a Perception check to detect the presence of others is 6d6×10 feet. In a swamp, this distance is 2d8×10 feet. Vegetation and deep bogs provide plentiful concealment (20% miss chance), so it is possible to use Stealth to hide in a marsh.</p>",
