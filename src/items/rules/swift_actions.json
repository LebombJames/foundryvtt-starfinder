Some skills use swift actions, but special abilities are almost never swift actions.</p>\n<h2>Change Grips</h2>\n<p>Changing your grip on a weapon, such as going from wielding a two-handed weapon with both hands to holding it in one hand, is a swift action.</p>\n<h2>Drop Prone</h2>\n<p>Dropping to a prone position in your space is a swift action.</p>",
