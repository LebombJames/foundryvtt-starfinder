  "content": "<p>&gt;@Compendium[sfrpg.rules.lRtz3KadYxtrd5qS]{Biomes}</p>\n<p>Source: CRB pg. 397</p>\n<p>Urban terrain can be found in most settlements where the people have greatly exerted their influence over the surrounding environment, constructing buildings where they can live and work in comfort and laying well-defined roads, usually paved. This type of terrain can occur in just about any biome, and it often supersedes the environmental effects of that biome. Urban terrain can include space stations, and it is often replete with technology. The most common rules sections to reference when using urban terrain are @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.TN4VeY75Z2Ce8IT7]{Settlements} (see page 405), @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.CPkDG7SXnJ0ky8px]{Structures} (see page 406), and Vehicles (see page 228), as well as @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.zDW0cDPQL55G7ose]{Breaking Objects} (see page 409) and sometimes @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.QHtKixa59DI9xQfO]{Radiation} (see page 403).</p>\n<h3>Stealth And Detection In Urban Terrain</h3>\n<p>In a settlement with wide, open streets, the maximum distance at which a creature can succeed at a Perception check to detect the presence of others is 2d6×10 feet. In a settlement where the buildings are more crowded, standing close together, this distance is 1d6×10 feet. The presence of crowds might reduce this distance.<br /><br />Thanks to twisting side streets and vehicles that can provide cover, it’s usually easy for a creature to use Stealth to hide in a settlement. In addition, settlements are often noisy, making Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, usually increasing the DC of the check at the GM’s discretion.</p>",
